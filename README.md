# tetrAIsgame
ML-ready JS Tetris clone

## Why another Tetris clone ?
The purpose of this version is to allow the game to expose usefull both data about its state and interaction methods thus enabling both human and AI to play it.
This version follows [Tetris Guideline](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline)

## What's in it ?
- Graphics: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library
- AI: [Toy Neural Network](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS)

## Progress
- [x] Tetris game following Tetris Guideline
- [x] Prepare data for NN: (normalizing...)
- [ ] Use Genetic Algorithm to "train" Neural Network
- [ ] Maybe submit to [The Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain), since this project is highly inspired by them.
- [ ] Maybe submit crossover function added to the Toy NN to [The Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain), since this project needed this code and it could be used for neuro-evolution projects.
